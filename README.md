On August 12th 2021 the AEC published this video: [The Senate count: Check, then check again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AqN-Y25qQo&t=115s).
From 1:55 to 2:14, Tom Rogers (the current Australian Electoral Commissioner) says:

> After the election, all of the data from that count is online.
> People can reconstruct the entire count and, in fact, they do so.
> So there's no-- not only are there no issues with the software that we use, that we've developed, but even if there were, it would be picked up... when people reconstruct the entire count using the data that we put online, and that doesn't happen.

On June 7th 2022 the following FOI request was lodged: (LEX3029)

> Documents pertaining to all recent records of third parties independently verifying the AEC's count. Here, recent means: the past two election cycles (approx 6 years).
>
> These include: lists of such verifications, notes on the methodological errors of such verifications, initial communications that the AEC has made with third party verifiers who have made methodological issues, minutes regarding considering third party verifications good enough to be valid, etc.

This repo contains the documents released under LEX3029.

Document 4 is a research paper by Dr Andrew Conway & A/Prof Vanessa Teague titled "Corrections to the AEC's counting code, and recommended amendments to the Electoral Act, for Senate Counting & Scrutiny".

Note: The Conway/Teague paper (Document 4) was sent to the AEC on August 31st 2021, 19 days *after* the AEC's video was published.
